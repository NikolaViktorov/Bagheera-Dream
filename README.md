# Bagheera's Dream

This is a website for my family's business which is our cattery for British Shorthair cats.

## Cats 🐱

The website has a couple of pages where you can explore the cats that we (in Bagheera's Dream cattery) have in the moment. You can also see for each cat if it has it's father and mother added to the site by viewing the cat's details page.

## Future plans 😺
In the future there are plans to adding cat litters in our website. The cat litters will be a group of small kittens which father and mother will be shown and those kittens will be up for sale. You will be able to 'order' a kitten through our website or by calling the phone number in the footer.

The public pets will have liking and paging system so you could like your other people's pets and also if there are too many pets added, there will be paging so you do not have to see all of them at once.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
